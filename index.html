          <div class="panel">
            <p>I have work experience in social media managing where I was able to create
              and share posts on the company's Instagram and Facebook. Doing this for over a year lead me to decied to go back to post-secondary and major in graphic design. 
              Since being at SAIT I have felt this is 100% something I want to do for my career.

          <button class="accordion">Art Background</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>My parents are not artistic although I do still have many artistic people in my family.
              Growing up my grandfather and my great aunt taught me how to draw. From seeing my great aunts portraits all over my family members houses I got a lot of insperation and really got into portraits. 
              Although I realized I am more interested and talented in digital art and painting. In high school I always chose art as one of my electives, 
              art has always been a safe space for me no matter if it's doodling on a page or spending hours on something I have always loved it. 
              Often I find myself doodling on pages even in class but it does help me focus I find.

          <div class="panel">
            <p>Hi! My name is Amanda Spears and I am a 21 year old graphic design student at SAIT. 
              I was born in Richmond BC and have moved to a few places around BC, but until moving to Calgary for school I had lived in the East Kootenays for about 10 years (also in BC).
              I grew up with an older brother and two older step sisters, having a large family has taught me many things. Mostly I have found
              it is very easy for me to get along with people as well as create meaningful relationships whether it be professionally or personally.
              Now I am planning to move to Calgary permanently and I am very excited to continue my education and start my career here!
            </p>
